IMPORTANT: Avoid commands that cause output buffering issues

DO NOT pipe output through head, tail, less, or more when monitoring or checking command output
DO NOT use | head -n X or | tail -n X to truncate output - these cause buffering problems
Instead, let commands complete fully, or use --max-lines flags if the command supports them
For log monitoring, prefer reading files directly rather than piping through filters

When checking command output:

Run commands directly without pipes when possible
If you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g., git log -n 10 instead of git log | head -10)
Avoid chained pipes that can cause output to buffer indefinitely
